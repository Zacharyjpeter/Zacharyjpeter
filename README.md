<h1>Hi I'm Zachary 👋🏾</h1>
<h2>My Story</h2>
I got into coding after redesigning <a href="https://ou.edu/moneycoach">the website for my current job as a MoneyCoach</a>. Using Adobe Experience Manager and a bit of CSS, I made the site more student friendly. As a MoneyCoach, I explain financial jargon and teach first year college students. So I'd say my superpower is simplifying information! The website was my first real proof of that.
<br>
<br>In my free time I learn HTML and do customer support for Zogo. Zogo is a fintech startup and gamified learning app. Their target audience is Gen Z and their mission compliments my MoneyCoach work. <a href="https://zogo.com"> You can check out their website here.</a>
