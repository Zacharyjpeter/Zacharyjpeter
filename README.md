# Hi I'm Zachary üëãüèæ
I'm a web developer. I started coding after redesigning [OU's MoneyCoach Website](https://ou.edu/moneycoach) with Adobe Experience Manager. I'm learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Github helps track my progress.

### Noteworthy Projects

Based on [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) and [CodeCademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) curriculum. The * means I built the project from scratch using a photo with no guide
