<h1>What's up! I'm Zachary 🤓👋🏾</h1>
<br/>
I'm interested in front end web and mobile app development. I've been learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript - officially! - since July 2022. My professional background is in higher education and finance. So ideally my next role would incorporate all these interests.
<br>
<br>
I got into coding after redesigning the website for my current job as a MoneyCoach. Using Adobe Experience Manager and a bit of CSS, I was able to make the site more user friendly. The website is one of my proudest achievements thus far. I'm currently a MoneyCoach at the University of Oklahoma and I teach a few first year college courses. I also do freelance customer support for Zogo - a gamified financial literacy app targeting Gen Z. You can check out Zogo on the App Store and Google Play!
