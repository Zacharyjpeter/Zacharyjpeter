<h1>What's up! I'm Zachary 🤓👋🏾</h1>
<br/>
I've been learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript since July 2022. I'm interested in front end web and mobile app development. My professional background is in higher education and finance. Ideally my next role would incorporate the two.

<h2>My Story</h2>
I got into coding after redesigning <a href="https://ou.edu/moneycoach">the website for my current job as a MoneyCoach</a>. Using Adobe Experience Manager and a bit of CSS, I was able to make the site more student friendly. That website is one of my proudest achievements so far. I work in financial aid at the University of Oklahoma and also teach two college courses for first year students. So I'd say my professional superpower is simplifying information. In my free time I learn HTML and do contractor work for Zogo. Zogo is a startup company and a gamified financial literacy app for Gen Z. Their mission compliments my work at OU and my interest in tech. Plus their app is genuinely a cool idea! <a href="https://zogo.com">You can check out their website here.</a>
