<h1>What's up! I'm Zachary 🤓👋🏾</h1>
I've been learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript (officially) since July 2022. I'm interested in front end web and mobile development. My professional background is in higher education and finance. Ideally my next role would incorporate the two.
<br>
<br>
<h2>My Story</h2>
I got into coding after redesigning <a href="https://ou.edu/moneycoach">the website for my current job as a MoneyCoach</a>. Using Adobe Experience Manager and a bit of CSS, I made the site more student friendly. As a MoneyCoach, I explain financial jargon and teach college courses for first year students. So I'd say my professional superpower is simplifying information! The website was my first real proof of that.
<br>
<br>In my free time I learn HTML and do customer support for Zogo. Zogo is a fintech startup and gamified learning app. Their target audience is Gen Z and their mission compliments my MoneyCoach work. <a href="https://zogo.com"> You can check out their website here.</a>
